						<p>Shakespeare's poetic reference to beer demonstrates its esteemed position in society, even during the 17th century.
							However, his preference is solely a personal choice, which would likely be a topic of debate among enthusiasts.
							 Beer has a longstanding cultural significance, enjoyed across diverse regions with unique brewing traditions.</p>
							 
					   <p> In the current globalised market, beer has become a shared experience with a wide range of preferences. 
						   While some beers have gained universal acclaim, others have sparked debate due to differences in flavor, regional brewing methods, and cultural context. 
						   This dynamic interplay of preference and locality has turned some brews into cultural symbols and conversation starters.</p>

					   <p> The objective is to gain insight into the factors influencing the varying perceptions of beers. 
						   The analysis will focus on several categories: from « controversial » brews, which are those that receive polarised reviews, to « universal » beers, which enjoy more consistent praise. 
						   The study analyses both quantitative ratings and textual reviews in order to examine how sensory attributes, such as aroma, appearance, palate and taste, influence consumer opinion. 
						    Furthermore, we analyse the sentiment within the reviews, identifying recurring keywords and phrases associated with these two types of beers. 
						   The study also examines regional differences and compares the input of novices and experts in order to gain insight into why some beers have broad appeal while others are the subject of intense debate.</p>

					   <p>Grab your favorite brew, and let's explore what the data says about the beers that stir up the strongest reactions.</p>

						<br>
						<br>
						<br>

						<h1>Research questions</h1>
						<p>The following key questions define how this study is structured and what are the main topic that we will explore.</p>						
						<ul class="default" style="margin-left: 50px;">
							<li>How can we define controversiality and can we distinguish these two classes effectively?</li>
							<br>
							<li>Does the sentiment analyses match the rating, can we match the attributes with the sexntiment analyses? Can the sentiment analyses help with the definition of controversiality ?</li>
							<br>
							<li>Which attributes, such as aroma, appearance, palate, and taste, are most associated with a beer being perceived as controversial?</li>
							<br>
							<li>Are certain regions more likely to produce controversial beers or to have distinct, less popular opinions? Are locally brewed beers rated more controversially compared to foreign ones?</li>
							<br>
							<li>Does the number of reviews made by the reviewer contribute to controversial ratings? Does the origin of the rater have an impact on the rating?</li>
