						<p>Shakespeare's poetic reference to beer demonstrates its esteemed position in society, even during the 17th century.
							However, his preference is solely a personal choice, which would likely be a topic of debate among enthusiasts.
							 Beer has a longstanding cultural significance, enjoyed across diverse regions with unique brewing traditions.</p>
							 
					   <p> In the current globalised market, beer has become a shared experience with a wide range of preferences. 
						   While some beers have gained universal acclaim, others have sparked debate due to differences in flavor, regional brewing methods, and cultural context. 
						   This dynamic interplay of preference and locality has turned some brews into cultural symbols and conversation starters.</p>

					   <p> The objective is to gain insight into the factors influencing the varying perceptions of beers. 
						   The analysis will focus on several categories: from « controversial » brews, which are those that receive polarised reviews, to « universal » beers, which enjoy more consistent praise. 
						   The study analyses both quantitative ratings and textual reviews in order to examine how sensory attributes, such as aroma, appearance, palate and taste, influence consumer opinion. 
						    Furthermore, we analyse the sentiment within the reviews, identifying recurring keywords and phrases associated with these two types of beers. 
						   The study also examines regional differences and compares the input of novices and experts in order to gain insight into why some beers have broad appeal while others are the subject of intense debate.</p>

					   <p>Grab your favorite brew, and let's explore what the data says about the beers that stir up the strongest reactions.</p>

						<br>
						<br>

						<h2>Research questions</h2>
						<p>The following key questions define how this study is structured and what are the main topic that we will explore.</p>						
						<ul class="default" style="margin-left: 50px;">
							<li>How can we define controversiality and can we distinguish these two classes effectively?</li>
							<br>
							<li>Does the sentiment analyses match the rating, can we match the attributes with the sexntiment analyses? Can the sentiment analyses help with the definition of controversiality ?</li>
							<br>
							<li>Which attributes, such as aroma, appearance, palate, and taste, are most associated with a beer being perceived as controversial?</li>
							<br>
							<li>Are certain regions more likely to produce controversial beers or to have distinct, less popular opinions? Are locally brewed beers rated more controversially compared to foreign ones?</li>
							<br>
							<li>Does the number of reviews made by the reviewer contribute to controversial ratings? Does the origin of the rater have an impact on the rating?</li>
						</ul>

							<h2>Data presentation</h2>
						</header>

						<p>
							To maintain consistency in our analysis, we format all data, including text, into CSV files. We then dive deeper into the data and uncover an interesting observation: breweries, beers, and even users appear in both RateBeer and BeerAdvocate. 
							Additionally, there are cases where a brewery in one dataset corresponds to multiple entries in the other dataset. Since our goal is to determine whether a beer is more controversial or more universally accepted, we merged the two datasets into one. 
							The result is a unified dataset for each feature, including beers, breweries, users, and reviews, with matching IDs across them. More details on how the datasets were merged can be found here.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now that the data is presented in a more manageable format and , we can begin examining its core content. We start by looking at the number of beers, reviews, breweries, and users in our dataset.
						</p>
						<div class="image" style="text-align: center;">
							<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dataset summary</strong></h3>
							<img src="images/dataset_summary.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
						</div>
						<p>
							This dataset offers a rich source of information for our analysis. Fortunately, approximately <strong>90% of the beers have at least one review</strong>, ensuring that our findings will be both meaningful and insightful. 
							For this project, we will focus only on these beers.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, it’s important to note that our dataset is not fully representative. The majority of the reviews are from American, meaning our analysis largely reflects preferences and tastes specific to them. 
							We chose not to rebalance the dataset, as doing so would have excluded a variety of brews and reviews, which are still relevant for our later analysis. 
							The following plot presents the 20 countries with the most reviews in our dataset.
						</p>
						<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/20776364"><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Top 20 countries by number of beer reviews</strong></h3><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20776364/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="hierarchy visualization" /></noscript></div>
						<p>
							The reviews on both websites are structured in the same way: users can rate the appearance, aroma, palate, and taste of each beer, in addition to providing an overall grade for each beer. 
							However, we encounter our first issue here: the grading scales differ between the datasets, which complicates direct comparison. Let’s see how we address this!
						</p>

						<h4><strong>Grade distribution and transformation</strong></h4>

						<p>
							BeerAdvocate allow the user to rate the five attributes on a scale of 1 to 5 with a resolution of 0.25, while RateBeer allow the user to rate aroma and taste between 1 and 10, appearance palate between 1 and 5 and overall between 1 and 20, all with a resolution of 1.
							<br>
							To perform our analysis, we must transform the grades to have the same scale between the two dataset. We decided to set the grade between 1 and 5 as most attributes are graded with this range. This is done by converting RateBeer scales according to the following formula : 

							\[
							\frac{\text{grade} - \text{min}}{\text{max} - \text{min}} \cdot 4 + 1
							\]
						
							<ul>
								<li>with \(\text{max}\) is the largest grade one can give to a given attribute.</li>
								<li>with \(\text{min}\) is the lowest grade one can give to a given attribute.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							A problem is still remaining, the grades do not have the same resolution at all. This will be seen further in the analysis.

							<h2>Exploring the definition of controversiality</h2>
						</header>

						<p>
							To find controversiality in our dataset, we first need to understand what it is and how we may look for it in all that data. Here is global definition to begin with:
						</p>
						<dl>
							<dt>Controversial:</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>"subject of intense public argument, disagreement, or disapproval" 
								<sup>[<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/controversial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>]</sup>
								</p>
							</dd>
						</dl>
						<p>
							We can see that the definition is quite broad and can be applied to many different situations. 
							In our case, we will focus on the beers that have the most polarized reviews, the one that may cause an argument, or a least a disagreament, if you would enter in a bar with a Shakespeare fan. 
							As a result, this analysis only depends on the fields the users can fulfill, namely, the different ratings : appearance, aroma, palate, taste, overall, and the textual reviews
							<br>
							Our first analysis is based on the grades provided by the user. To do so, we will look at the variance. 
							It measures the spread of the data around the mean, reflecting the level of disagreement among ratings. 
							Furthermore, it is consistent across all attributes as it is dimension-independent, relying only on the grades given by the users.
